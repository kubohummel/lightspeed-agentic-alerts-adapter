# System Overview

The alerts adapter polls OpenShift AlertManager and creates `AgenticRun` resources to start analysis and remediation through the Lightspeed Agentic operator. It runs as one replica, only creates runs, and has no persistent storage. It keeps target information and creation backoff in memory.

## Behavioral Rules

### System Role

1. The adapter SHALL poll AlertManager at a configurable interval (default 30 seconds), fetch active alerts, and create runs that pass filtering and deduplication.
2. The adapter SHALL run as a single-replica deployment. The default namespace SHALL be `openshift-lightspeed`.
3. The adapter SHALL run an immediate poll on startup so it can see alerts still firing after a restart. Alerts that resolve during downtime may not be seen.
4. All AgenticRuns SHALL be created in the adapter namespace selected by `POD_NAMESPACE`. The alert's namespace SHALL go in `spec.targetNamespaces`, not `metadata.namespace`.
5. HTTP 409 AlreadyExists on creation SHALL be a no-op. The adapter SHALL not update or delete existing runs, including when alerts resolve.

### Component Responsibilities

6. Alert retrieval SHALL request active, non-silenced, non-inhibited alerts. Local requests SHALL read the ServiceAccount token on each call and use the service CA for TLS.
7. Run construction SHALL produce deterministic names, alert metadata, and an investigation request using the rules in [AgenticRun building](agenticrun-building.md).
8. Filtering and deduplication SHALL apply receiver selection, pre-run delay, active-run checks, cooldown, and creation backoff in that order. Several alerts in one stable group can share an active run.
9. Configuration SHALL be loaded once at startup from `/etc/alerts-adapter/config.yaml`. File changes SHALL require a process restart.
10. The suspension check SHALL read the `AgenticOLSConfig` singleton named `cluster` before each cycle's alert and run operations.
11. Multicluster discovery SHALL list and watch `SpokeCluster` resources and update the set of targets used by later cycles.

### Integration Points

12. The adapter SHALL create `agentic.openshift.io/v1alpha1` `AgenticRun` resources. The agentic operator owns their workflow and cleanup after creation.
13. Multicluster mode SHALL discover cluster-scoped `hub.openshift.io/v1alpha1` `SpokeCluster` resources.
14. Alert retrieval SHALL use the AlertManager v2 alerts API.

### Lifecycle

15. SIGTERM or SIGINT SHALL cancel or complete in-flight work and stop the process cleanly.
16. The adapter SHALL write structured JSON logs for startup, shutdown, target failures, and creation results.
16a. Deduplication SHALL read Kubernetes state each cycle. Creation backoff SHALL be kept in memory and cleared on restart.

## Configuration Surface

File fields and defaults are defined in [configuration](configuration.md#configuration-surface).

| Startup setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ALERTMANAGER_URL` | `https://alertmanager-main.openshift-monitoring.svc:9094` | Local endpoint; an explicitly empty value disables the local target |
| `POD_NAMESPACE` | `openshift-lightspeed` | Namespace for runs and spoke credential Secrets |
| `--multicluster` | `false` | Enable spoke discovery alongside any local target |
| `MULTICLUSTER_MAX_CONCURRENT_TARGETS` | `4` | Positive target concurrency limit in multicluster mode; ignored in single-cluster mode |

## Deployment Ownership

The classic Lightspeed operator deploys the local adapter when `OLSConfig.spec.ols.deployment.alertsAdapter.configMapRef` is set. The hub operator deploys a separate multicluster adapter with local polling disabled. This repo also provides manifests for direct deployment. See the parent [deployment lifecycle](../../../../.ai/spec/what/deployment-lifecycle.md) and [multicluster contract](../../../../.ai/spec/what/alerts-adapter-multicluster.md).

## Constraints

- Terminal phases are Completed, Failed, Denied, Escalated, and EmergencyStopped. `NoActionRequired` is a reason on the Analyzed condition that derives as Completed.
- The desired name limit is 63 characters because the operator uses run names as label values. The long-namespace gap is recorded in [building rule 16a](agenticrun-building.md#metadata-sanitization).
- Cooldown for analysis-only completion remains a [planned correction](poll-loop.md#post-run-delay-cooldown).
- An empty receiver allowlist skips all alerts. There is no separate severity filter.
- There is no persistent database, HTTP health endpoint, or Prometheus metrics endpoint in the current adapter.
